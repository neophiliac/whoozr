The whoozr script looks for domains based on complete words that happen
to contain a TLD at the end, e.g. streptococcus or windbag.

Run with '-h' to see parameters.

Output shows available domains: (e.g.)
streptococc.us is available

Flaws: (notice I saved this for last)
It should spawn N threads to speed up the search.
It should handle 'whois' calls being throttled
It needs tests
